## Simple Temperature Conversion Application 

This Shiny Application is for interactively converting the temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 

The input temperature can be entered using the slider input and the value can be between -150 and 150.  The type of conversion desired can be selected by using the radio button. This lets the user select whether they want a *Celsius to Fahrenheit* conversion or a *Fahrenheit to Celsius* conversion. 

The output is presented in the main panel. Both the input and the converted temperature is shown along with the correct units. As well as a bar chart also graphically shows the conversion. The input is always plotted in Blue color and the output is in RED.
